# Terms of Service  
**Last Updated: 25 September 2025**

By inviting or using JADA Free Bot (“the Service”) you agree to these terms.

## 1. Access & License
We grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service within Discord servers you manage, subject to these Terms and Discord’s Terms of Service.

## 2. Acceptable Use
You may **not**:
1. Modify, reverse-engineer, or redistribute the Service.  
2. Use the Service to violate any law or Discord policy.  
3. Spam API endpoints or intentionally overload the Bot.

## 3. Service Availability
We aim for high uptime but provide the Service **“as-is.”** Outages, updates, or API limits may interrupt functionality. We are not liable for any resulting loss or damages.

## 4. Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use or inability to use the Service.

## 5. Termination
- We may suspend or terminate access at any time for violation of these Terms or Discord’s policies.  
- You may stop using the Service at any time by removing the Bot from your server.

## 6. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms when necessary. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
