# Privacy Policy  
**Effective Date: 25 September 2025**

JADA Free Bot (“the Bot”) values your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how you can control it.

## 1. Data We Collect
| Category | Details | Storage |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Guild configuration | IDs of guild, channels, categories, messages; selected options | Persisted locally in an encrypted file |
| Basic member metrics | Anonymous counts (totals, online, bots, etc.) | Calculated in memory, **not** stored |
| Join/leave logs | User ID, tag, timestamps (embedded in a message you choose) | Sent to your Discord channel only |

## 2. How We Use Data
- Operate counters, embeds, and logs.  
- Keep your settings after restarts.  
- Diagnose errors (console logs include guild ID only).

## 3. Sharing & Disclosure
We **never** sell or share data with third parties. Data is disclosed only when legally required.

## 4. Data Retention & Removal
- Configuration is kept until you run `/disable_stats` or remove the Bot, which deletes the guild entry automatically.  
- No personal message content is stored at any time.

## 5. Your Choices
- Use `/disable_stats` to erase stored configuration.  
- Remove the Bot from your server to purge all data automatically.
